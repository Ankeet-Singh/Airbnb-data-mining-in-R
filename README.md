# Airbnb-data-mining-in-R
Airbnb.com is a home-sharing platform where homeowners can rent out full houses, apartments, bedrooms, or beds. Airbnb hosts make money from renting out their properties; renters provide feedback by posting public ratings and comments regarding their stay.

For this data mining project, a model is created to predict 'high_booking_rate': that is, whether an Airbnb.com listing will have a high booking rate (numerical predictions for the probability that a listing will have a high booking rate), on a set of data for which the labels are not known. The resulting model can allow property listers to assess which attributes are the most sought-after by customers, thereby helping owners increase revenue from their properties.

The entire project has been done in R. As the data files are too large to host here, they can be found at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1exoRcdCm6FUbPECfsrGs2Qhowl0mNb09?usp=sharing
